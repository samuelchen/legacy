Favorite saying at this moment:
<div class="alt" style="float: left; margin-left: 30px; width: 410px;">
<div style="float: left; margin: 5px 2px 3px 3px;"><span style="font-family: book antiqua; font-size: 7;">**_T_**</span></div>
wenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn′t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails.

Explore. Dream. Discover.
