[一篇是关于2007中华骏捷的](http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/02/22/2007-zhonghua-jinjue-chinas-bmw/)，回复在43楼。

Hey pku043, you are nice but don't be too smart. It's political to guys who like Mookie(#9) & james(23#).

To all who said "fuck", DO NOT fuck anyone else but yourself. Feel free to talk with other like a friend pls.

Be genltle pls!

Mr./Ms. Mookie, I could list more than 10 "terrorist" things of your country if you tell me what is your country's name. Of course, you may do that simply with google. Pick out 10 things under debate as you wish and INSTALL "terrorist" on them!!!

[另一篇是关于2008中国车的国际贸易的争论](http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/03/16/chinese-car-to-arrive-in-2008-for-10k/)，回复在15楼。

WHUT, US always "fair trade" with its guns.

By the way, I like American systems such as legislation and administration. They are fair and effective.

And you should know that there was a dynasty called Tang in China. US today is not good enough relative to Tang. But Tang subverted.

There is a saying in China: No flower keeps sweet smelled for hundred days.

So I say, all the world should develop together.

虽然对现在的事情很多都看不惯也管不了，但绝对受不了别人侮辱中国，这是千万年的根。

骏捷？看起来不错，谁知道呢？
