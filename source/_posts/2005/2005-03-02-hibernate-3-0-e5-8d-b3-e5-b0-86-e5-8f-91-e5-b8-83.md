>![Hibernate Logo](http://www.samuelchen.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/hibernate_icon.gif "Hibernate Logo")  Hibernate 3.0 今天宣布候选版1（RC1）已经准备放出。这个全新的支持O/R/XML映射的版本包含了大量特性，全新的O/R查询功能，如Hibernate查询语言（HQL），增强的Hibernate标准查询API（HCQA）等。

*   Much more flexible O/R mapping: support for exotic association and inheritance mappings, and greater flexibility when working with legacy data.
*   Hibernate3 filters: a unique feature for working with temporal (historical), regional or permissioned data.
*   Unprecendented flexibility for mixing handwritten and generated SQL within a single application or even a single entity: full support for "derived" entities and attributes defined in the mapping document, full support for overriding any generated SQL statement with handwritten SQL, support for stored procedures.
*   Object/Relational/XML mapping: query XML directly from the database for reporting, replicate data between databases via intermediate XML, externalize entity data as XML when interacting with remote systems.
*   Enhanced ease of use: better defaulting, an unchecked exceptions model, simplified natural (and composite) key support, simplified CMT integration.
*   Enhanced Criteria query API: with full support for projection/aggregation and subselects.
*   Runtime performance monitoring: via JMX or local Java API, including a second-level cache browser.
*   Brand new AST-based HQL parser: bulk update/delete enhancement, better syntax validation.
*   JBoss EJB 3.0 preview: support for annotation-based O/R mappings, full support for EJB-QL 3.0, support for EJB 3.0 persist()/merge() lifecycle, JACC-based security model.
*   Hibernate Tools preview: a full suite of Eclipse plugins for working with Hibernate 3.0, including mapping editor, interactive query prototyping, schema reverse engineering tool.
*   Many new extension points: including a new, extensible, event-driven architecture
*   Documentation enhancements.
*   Brand new test suite, including many useful examples of exotic Hibernate mappings.
